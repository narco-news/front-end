This repository contains all of the code for the front end portion of [narco.news](narco.news). It is built with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) alongside [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. I started with the [nuxt-ghost-blog](https://github.com/moso/nuxt-ghost-blog) template but have reworked the look of it entirely and begun to implement internationalization. The back end is all handled by [ghost](https://ghost.org) which I'm running on an AWS EC2 t2.small.
