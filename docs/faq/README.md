# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this place

This is our information portal that is used to document various things
related to the topics we study.

## What can I do here

Well, currently you can only read the information that is contained within these
pages. But hopefully soon we will have implemented a system to be able to
accept contributations.

## Can I contribute to one of the pages

Not at the moment. But hopefully in the future that will be a possibility.

## Can I fix something that you got wrong

Unfortunately no. But you can yell at me on [social media](https://twitter.com/just_some_d00d).

## Why don't you have this on the website

There could be a million reasons. Maybe I forgot, maybe I haven't gotten
around to it yet, or maybe I just have no clue at all
so you should tell me! :)

## Why are some of these pages missing a lot of information

Because this place is still heavily being worked on.

## When do you plan to finish this place

Never.
